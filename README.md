# Documentations Study
 I'm going to use that repository to save files that I create or edit during my studies of documentations or support materials in sites as W3Schools, MDN Web Docs, etc.<br/>
 I intend to practice while I study and save things that I must know for when I need to review that I only use my notes. For that, I must use the site content to save time.<br/>
 Sites that I've been using:
 - https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp
