        <h1>Your first form</h1>
        <h2>What are web forms?</h2>
        <p>A web form's HTML is made up of one or more form controls (sometimes called widgets), plus some additional elements to help structure the overall form â€” they are often referred to as HTML forms.</p>
        <h2>Active learning: Implementing our form HTML</h2>
        <h3>The &lt;form&gt; element</h3>
        <p>All forms start with a &lt;form&gt; element. <span class="iwrote">It's a container dedicated to forms and can receive some attributes to change/define the form behavior. At least use 'action' and 'method' attribute.</span></p>
        <ul>
            <li>The action attribute defines the location (URL) where the form's collected data should be sent when it is submitted.</li>
            <li>The method attribute defines which HTTP method to send the data with (usually get or post).</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>The &lt;label&gt;, &ltinput&gt, and &lttextarea&gt elements</h3>
        
        <h3>The &lt;button&gt; element</h3>
        <h2>Basic form styling</h2>
